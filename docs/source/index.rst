MeasurementEventManager documentation
=====================================


The MeasurementEventManager (MEM) is an ecosystem for creating, running, and
tracking scientific experiments.
It was originally designed for use in microwave-domain quantum devices research
at the group of Mathieu Juan at the Institut Quantique at the Université de
Sherbrooke in Québec, Canada.
However, it aims to use a generally-agnostic structure and design principles,
so can in principle be used for any scientific experiments where a computer
interfaces with instruments to set stimuli and read recorded values.

For prospective users, the :doc:`design_principles` section will help you
understand if MEM is the right tool for your job, and what its strengths and
weaknesses are.

For existing or beginning users, the :doc:`usage` section provides examples to
familiarize you with the MEM workflow and its capabilities, with a
comprehensive API reference found under :doc:`api`.
