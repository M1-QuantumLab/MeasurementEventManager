Server plugins are essentially drivers for existing instrument control
software.
The MEM specifically does *not* aim to replace or supplant instrument control
software, and is instead intended as an additional abstraction layer on top
of it.
As such, the MEM Controller service requires a translation wrapper for the
targeted instrument server software, which is provided by an instrument server
plugin such as these included in the package.
